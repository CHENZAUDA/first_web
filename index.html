            <p><span>1.. Short Lifetime of Items - Garments only exist to be sold for a very short period of time. This
                    is
                    different to other verticals such as films or music which can always be purchased fairly easily for
                    a
                    very long time. The result is that in fashion each individual item only has a short period in which
                    to
                    collect data about it, meaning the domain ends up very sparse, even more so that in traditional
                    recommendation system domains.</br>

                    2.. High Volume of Items - Large retailers release new garments daily, meaning there is a constant
                    high
                    turnover of products. For example, fast fashion retailer Zara delivers new products to its stores
                    every
                    two weeks (Forbes). Not only does this create problems around understanding product availability,
                    but
                    also ensuring that the recommendation system is sophisticated enough to capture data on the garments
                    on
                    an ongoing basis.</span></p>
